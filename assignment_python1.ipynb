    "  In Python, an expression is a combination of values, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. Expressions are the building blocks of statements, and they represent computations that produce values. Every expression has a type and can be evaluated to a value, which can be used in various ways within a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions are made up of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: These can be literals like numbers (integers, floating-point), strings, or boolean values (True or False).\n",
    "Operators: These are symbols that perform operations on values. Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), logical operators (and, or, not), and more.\n",
    "Function Calls: Invoking functions with arguments is also a type of expression. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.\n",
    "All expressions, when evaluated, produce a value. The value can be of any data type, such as a number, string, boolean, or even a more complex data structure. Expressions are used extensively in programming for various purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculations: Expressions are used to perform calculations and mathematical operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "result = 3 + 5 * 2\n",
    "Comparisons: Expressions are used to compare values and determine relationships between them. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "is_equal = 10 == 5 * 2\n",
    "Boolean Logic: Expressions are used to create logical conditions that determine the flow of a program. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 0 and y < 10:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "String Manipulation: Expressions can concatenate strings or manipulate their contents. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "greeting = \"Hello, \" + name\n",
    "Function Calls: Function calls are expressions that can compute and return results. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "length = len(\"hello\")\n",
    "Data Manipulation: Expressions are used to work with data structures like lists, dictionaries, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, expressions in Python are combinations of values, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce results. They play a fundamental role in computations, comparisons, decision-making, and manipulating data within a program."

    "An expression is a combination of values, operators, and possibly function calls that can be evaluated to produce a single value. Expressions can be as simple as a single value (like a number or a string), or they can be complex combinations of values and operators. Expressions always result in a value when evaluated.\n",

    "A statement is a complete instruction that performs some action. Statements can include assignments, loops, conditionals, and function definitions. Unlike expressions, statements don't necessarily produce a value when executed. Instead, they might change the state of the program, control its flow, or define new behavior.\n",

    "Examples of statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment statement: spam = 10\n",
    "Conditional statement: if x > 5:\n",
    "Loop statement: for i in range(5):\n",
